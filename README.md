# LinearRegression
MachineLearning


I have some tiny data to represent how linear equation works:

Basically all we need to know is the linear equation formula, which is: <br>
**y = mx + b** 

y and x are any independent variables, x can be any value on the x axis and y can be any value on the Y axis <br>

m means slope, slope = rise / run and rise means Vertical axis and run is horizontal axis. <br>

b means intercept, means a point on the Y axis, the starting point from where we will start drawing the line at the end <br>

There are 4 steps to draw a graph using linear regression: <br>
1) Identify the slope and intercept <br>
2) Draw / Mark the y value of intercept
3) Use the slope to rise and run from the y intercept(b). Mark a point at this location
4) Connect the points from y intercepy(b) to form a line

If you are given this below: <br>

Now we can see that m(slope) is =  2/3 <br>
b(intercept value on Y axis) is = -3  <br>

so to draw the graph, we need to first use the b value. Is it minus? Yes so we go down on the Y axis, remember intercept only deals with Y axis <br>

so we moved to -3 on the Y axis <br>

Next we need to look at the slope value and we said that, slope = m = rise / run and rise is Y axis(vertical points) and run means horizontal axis.So since m = 2 / 3 we need to move +2(rise value of slope(m)) from -3 where the intercept point is, so if we move from -3 to 2 points upwards we get to -1  <br>

Next from -1,we now need to apply run, means move on horizontal line and ,run value is +3 so we move to the right 3 points and end up on +3 on the X axis <br>

And now we can start drawing our line starting from the intercept point(b) that is -3 on Y axis and continue drawing towards the slope that ended on +3 on X axis <br>

**Note that if the slope is 13 let's say its run value will be 1 , why? remember any whole number has a denominator of 1 so the slope becomes:**

**m = 13 / 1**
