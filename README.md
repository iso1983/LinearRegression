# LinearRegression
MachineLearning


I have some tiny data to represent how linear equation works:

Basically all we need to know is the linear equation formula, which is: \
**y = mx + b** \

y and x are any independent variables, x can be any value on the x axis and y can be any value on the Y axis \

m means slope, slope = rise / run and rise means Vertical axis and run is horizontal axis. \

b means intercept, means a point on the Y axis, the starting point from where we will start drawing the line at the end \

If you are given this below: \

Now we can see that m(slope) is =  2/3 \
b(intercept value on Y axis) is = -3  \

so to draw the graph, we need to first use the b value. Is it minus? Yes so we go down on the Y axis, remember intercept only deals with Y axis \

so we moved to -3 on the Y axis \

Next we need to look at the slope value and we said that, slope = m = rise / run and rise is Y axis(vertical points) and run means horizontal axis.So since m = 2 / 3 we need to move +2 from -3 where the intercept point is, so if we move from -3 to 2 points upwards we get to -1\

Next from -1,we now need to apply run, means move on horizontal line and ,run value is +3 so we move to the right 3 points and end up on +3 on the X axis \

And now we can start drawing our line starting from the intercept point(b) that is -3 on Y axis and continue drawing towards the slope that ended on +3 on X axis \
